Wine Quality Prediction

Overview

This project involves the development of machine learning models to predict wine quality. The models are built using the Python programming language and several machine learning libraries.

Features

Data Loading: The project uses the pandas library to load wine quality data from a CSV file.
Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values and selecting relevant features.
Model Training and Evaluation: Utilizes Decision Tree and Random Forest models from sklearn for predicting wine quality.
Performance Measurement: Evaluates models using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Synthetic Data Generation: Generates synthetic data for testing model predictions.
Models Used

Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Libraries Used

pandas
sklearn (scikit-learn)
numpy
Usage

Data Loading: Load your wine quality dataset.
Feature Selection: Choose features such as 'total_sulfur_dioxide', 'pH', and 'chlorides'.
Model Training: Train models using the training dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using the validation dataset.
Synthetic Data Generation: Generate synthetic data and use it to predict wine quality with the trained model.
Running the Project

Ensure that you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. Run the script using Python in your preferred development environment.
